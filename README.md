# Sarcasm Detection and Classification

Sarcasm detection is a critical yet difficult task in the Natural Language Processing community. In my project, I use the iSarcasm dataset to attempt two SemEval 2022 SubTasks: To determine whether or not a tweet is sarcastic, and to classify the ironic speech category a text belongs to: sarcasm, irony, satire, understatement, overstatement, and rhetorical question. Through this project I explored a variety of BERT-based models that leverage average pooling and CNN layers, leveraged techniques such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling, and used hyperparameter tuning to complete both tasks. The success my models achieved suggest that BERT-based models may be a good basis for modeling sarcasm detection and classification.
